# Determinant-Solver
As the name suggests, this Python (.py) file solves the determinant for a square matrix (n* n).
When we run the Python file, we enter the dimension/size of our square matrix, suppose we enter n=3.
In the next step, we enter the values of the square matrix in the next n* n = 3* 3 = 9 lines.
We'll get the answer (determinant) after entering all the n* n values. Yayyy!
